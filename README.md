## Vision


Play Log is an all access, none turned away way to keep track of ones exercises.
A lot of applications focus on the end goal of losing weight and counting calories
but this one focuses instead on the enjoyment of each exercise and the process
which brought you there

## Preparation

1. Fork and clone this repo
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install` and `bower install`.
1. Go here to follow the instructions to spin up the Play Log Repos
1.  Start the font-end server with `ember server --proxy http://localhost:3000`.

## From end to end

Watch as I sign up for a new account on our demo app.

*Aside from flashy messages on the page did anything change in the Chrome Dev*
*Tools?*

Take some time and sign in on your own, and check to see if anything in the
Chrome Dev Tools has changed.

Now that we have added a key tool to our personal developer toolkit lets look
at how it is implimented and the rest of the code.

## Follow Along

As a class let's walk through file by file what is happening. I will ask
developers to guide me through the files while correcting any misunderstandings.

First let's start down the template and component trail, then we'll work our way
up with actions.

*Remember: Data down, actions up.*

While going up the Ember hierarchy we may need to stop a some point to discuss
services.
