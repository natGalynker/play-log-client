## Vision
A Place for logging you exercises, your way for starting projects Built with Ruby on Rails using Postgres. It was build for the Play Log Application.

Play Log is an all access, none turned away way to keep track of ones exercises.
A lot of applications focus on the end goal of losing weight and counting calories
but this one focuses instead on the enjoyment of each exercise and the process
which brought you there. It allows you to view all your exercises in one place,
and mark them when done. You can also remove the workout which are no longer
relevent to you.

It is built with Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Bootstrap and EmberJS

## Preparation

1. Fork and clone this repo
1. Install dependencies with `npm install` and `bower install`.
1.Go to [Play Log API]  (http://github.com/natGalynker/play-log-api)  to follow the instructions to spin up the Play Log API Repos
1. Start the font-end server with `ember server --proxy http://localhost:3000`.

## User Stories
1. As A User I want to be able to view my exercises
2. As A User I want to be able to create new exercises
3. As A USer I want to be able to Delete an exercise
4. As A user I want to be Able to keep my exercises private




## Vision For the Future


In the time approaching there will be improvements to this project. There will
be a drop down selector for the type of exercise, along with a thrid party
intergration that will allow a user to set a target for how many times a week
they would like to complete an exercise. If they complete their goal, they will
revieve an sms text informing them!


##Struggles

I had to overcome some pretty big hurdles. One of them was a pretty significant
bug which caused me to dial it back and ended up resulting in biting the bullet
and starting the project over with renewed focus. It seemed that there would be
a lot more of a stuggle with me fighting the bug than with me starting over. But that
process was a learning exerperience so I linked the previous project here as well.
This hurdle really helped me let go of the attachment I had to the vision I originally had and refocus in a way that led to some much more manageable and code I am very
proud of in the end.
